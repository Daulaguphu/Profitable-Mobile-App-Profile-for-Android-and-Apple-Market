# Dataquest-Guided-Project-1
This project is a part of Dataquest-Guided-Data-Science-Project

### Goal
Our main goal for this project is to give recommendations about the genre of application that will be profiting both for the Android and Apple market. The application will focus on user engagement as its main source of revenues by displaying in-app advertisements and this application will also be free and for English-speaking users. For our analysis, we use Google Play Store and Apple App Store datasets containing records of applications available in both markets.
